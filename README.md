Miai - Ruby Apps for iOS and Android
====================================

Miai is an open source project for the Ruby community to allow the generation of native iOS and Android mobile applications from a single ruby code base.  These applications are built on the RubyMotion (www.rubymotion.com) and Ruboto (http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-ruby/) projects.  Miai takes Ruby code and builds it for each of these projects for further deployment on the devices for development and testing and builds packages suitable for distribution in the corresponding App Stores.

   * Miai  is a Domain Specific Language - DSL for mobile apps that abstracts a common object model and component specifications into a device independent specification.  Miai allows for easy integration of native specific code and constructs so that platform specific features can be supported in a single code base.
   * The Miai project comes with a set of Rakefile specifications and generators to allow for the easy generation of test and production application packages for each of the supported platforms
   * Miai is a Ruby Gem for easy installation
   * Miai.app is a commercial product in the Apple OSX App store that packages a complete Ruby Development environment for OSX based on the Tokaido project targeted for the new ruby developer or the busy professional. (Note: Miai.app is not required all Miai components will be available as Ruby Gems)

Status: Only a manifesto at this point.  Hoping to get a hello world app out after the weekend.

Miai - In Japanese means match making  or literarily looking at one another. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miai)
